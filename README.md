Orvibo Controller
=================

A basic little .NET application to turn the Orvibo S20 on and off automatically for testing purposes.

This is based on Andrius Stikonas and others' work as documented here https://stikonas.eu/wordpress/2015/02/24/reverse-engineering-orvibo-s20-socket/

The discovery feature is not currently working and needs further investigation.

However manual control of an S20 for which you have the IP address and MAC address is possible.

The UI utility can be used to set cycle on/off times and a max cycle count for testing.
